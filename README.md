# Random Business Card Generator

## Description

Task is to build a random business card that fetches a random user data.

The API I'm using is [randomUser](https://randomuser.me/) a free API that doesn’t require an account to get started.

> - The [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, 
such as requests and responses. It also provides a global `fetch()` method that provides an easy, 
logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.

- First I get started by creating a HTML file.
- Next in the common.js file I’ll make my request using the Fetch API.
- If the request was successful, I'm passing this data to a function that will render it into the HTML.
- All that’s left to do is add the CSS.
